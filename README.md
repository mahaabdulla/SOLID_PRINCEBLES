# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles Practice Project

ðŸ§© What Are the SOLID Principles?

    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    Every class should have only one reason to change.

    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    Objects of subclasses should be replaceable with objects of the superclass without breaking the system.

    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    Classes should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a Dart-based practice project focused on applying the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** â€” the first of the five SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The goal is to write clean, modular, and testable code by splitting the responsibilities of a `Person` class into dedicated components:

- Validation (input rules)
- BMI calculation (business logic)
- Data persistence (history storage)
