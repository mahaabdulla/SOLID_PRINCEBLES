# ðŸ§± SOLID Principles Practice Project

ðŸ§© What Are the SOLID Principles?

    S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    Every class should have only one reason to change.

    O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

    L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    Objects of subclasses should be replaceable with objects of the superclass without breaking the system.

    I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    Classes should not be forced to implement interfaces they do not use.

    D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    Classes should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations
## ðŸ”§ How the Principles Were Applied

### âœ… Example 1: SRP  
The `UserManager` class is only responsible for managing users, while the `Logger` class handles logging.
